i am ethan and i exist (??????)

anyways.... do not disrupt my sleep (even when you think i
should be awake), do not ask me for ETA for anything, or i
will bash you in the head with a comically large metal pipe.

## account clarification

So my usual (personal) account is at [github.com/rapidcow](/rapidcow),
but because i am egostical and want to create an account
with my name, and because i also like to maintain distance
with school and work, i made this account.  you will see
commits under this user in repository, that's normal because
i have to make a decision splitting the emails between the
two accounts.

## ABOUT J\*B

please just go to www.endfindme.com. also i'm
just a sophomore in case that disappoints you

The email you should use is **hire** at (my domain)
where (my domain) can be endfindme.com *or* endfind.me
*or* (my main account's username) (dot) org.

please do not email arbitrary Git commit emails.
it's not like i can control what you do, but c'mon...
don't be annoying.  We're not friends, and you don't
get to call me Ethan. >:(
