## about me in your projects

here are some reasons you may *not* want me in your project
(since apparently it takes some people an in-person meeting
to realize these blatantly obvious signs)

* I support Free and Open Software and despise mega corporations.
  I hate OneNote and OneDrive with a passion.  However, I have
  nothing against OneNote / OneDrive / Windows / Microsoft *users*.
  If Microsoft works for you, then great!  It didn't for me, and
  I am abstaining from most Microsoft products and services
  (including GitHub).  But if you must have *me* become a sycophant
  of big corporations, I assure you that you will be disappointed.
* I enjoy open file formats and open protocols.  I despite Walled
  Gardens, proprietary database schemas, obfuscated JavaScript,
  and more.  I despite software used to spy on, control, collect
  personally identifiable information of, and/or manipulate people.
  While I *deeply respect* your choice if you choose to keep *your*
  technology private and proprietary, if you find the mere thought
  of this polar opposite kind of person in your room repulsive,
  do not invite me to such room in the first place.
* to add to the previous point: I believe everyone owns their data,
  their information.  User content is confidential by default and
  must be taken seriously or destroyed entirely, not anywhere between.
  Users reserve the right to obtain an exact copy of all data the
  service collects of them, at any point of time, for absolutely
  any reason.  Users deserve to know how their service works,
  where it processes and stores their data, and how they can ensure
  that their data is erased.  (I must expressly state that this does
  *not* mean to erase user's *access* to the data --- the deletion
  as reflected on the user interface *must* correspond to a deletion
  in the server database within a reasonable timeframe.)  And finally,
  users should be the one to grant consent to their data being
  distributed to any third-party, and that all such distribution
  should be written in clear, terse, non-legalese speak.
* **I do not support the distribution of effortful/confidential text data**
  (such as blog articles, user-created content, personal information)
  **to large language models such as ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Google
  Gemini, Deepseek; or image/audio data of similar nature** (such as
  artwork, animations, and photography/videography of real faces/voices)
  **to image/audio-generation diffusion models**.  If you do not
  make an effort to cease any of the above acts (or at the very least
  *clarify* to your users that your service does this), I do not
  want to work with you (nor do I think you me to work for you).
* I am (undiagnosed, but very possibly) autistic and will interpret
  your words very literally, and may criticize you very directly.
  That isn't to say that I don't care about your feelings; I just
  believe that corporate get-along "friendliness" is the *lack* of
  capacity to care about whatever the heck you are talking about.
* I may "steal" work, but I make sure to give credit to people
  whose work I benefit from whenever I can.  A friend, an artist
  on the Web, a humble programmer --- even a s&#42;&#42;tpost YouTuber.
  If you are the egotistical, all-eyes-on-me kind of person, I would
  rather lay my eyes on anyone but you.
  
  Oh, and I am not a saint, but I think I deserve to be credited for 
  the work I have done.  If you think you can have me do work promoting
  your idea, while making it sound like you made it all, you may consider
  looking for people who have no ego or self-respect instead.  (Actually,
  for the sake of their well-being, don't go looking for anyone at all.
  If you can't be bothered to thank people for helping while wanting it
  to sound like you do all the work, you might as well deserve to do it
  alone to live up to the prophecy.)
* I do not enjoy AI buzzwords.  I do not vibe code.  I care about
  keeping things low-tech and accessible (my commitment is a different
  topic as I am aware of how difficult it is to maintain low-energy or
  compatibility without stifling progress; but suffice it to say, I do
  not *intentionally* make bloatware or endorse "planned obsolescence".)  
  (I may vibe code for *your* codebase!  But please keep that slop
  as far away from my personal projects as possible.)
* [I am a f&#42;&#42;king webmaster](https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/).
  I do not make websites for commerce (with the *sole* exception being
  www.endfindme.com, because surprise, I have to live).  I do not make
  websites to look tall, staggering, formiddable.  Or paint a reality
  with plastic faces, with corporate clipart, with the urban minimalist
  aesthetics; sterile and idyllic; sweetening to the point of sickening.
  Making is my passion; it's so I can bring change to the world.
  It's so that someone can find peace --- that I can find peace --- in
  a chaotic world and the unrelenting flow of time, overwhelmed by senses
  and overridden by confusion, crushed by the apathetic and hurt by the
  careless... that doesn't come from the rejection of human nature
  and imperfection; or a detachment from the range and capacity of
  human emotions; but rather embrace it, cherish it, and spend every
  second not regretting to be human in it.  
  (I may make exceptions for you; I can't say the same about you for me!)
* also, i am a chinese from mainland China --- not Chinese--American,
  not hong kongnese, not macanese, or taiwanese.  That doesn't mean i am
  into politics (well, at least not for its own sake) or take a stance on
  controversial international things in general (or that i care to engage
  in such hurtful things), or that i am partial for other mainland Chinese
  people, or that i agree with everything the CCP does or has done, or that
  i am (or am not) pro-Taiwan, pro-America, or pro anything.  That doesn't
  even suggest the slightest that i would treat you differently because
  you (assuming you are ethnic Chinese) do not call
  yourself Chinese (it is your choice and I do not care).  But it is *my*
  choice to call *myself* Chinese, and if my ethnicity and/or nationality
  *alone* concerns you, it is in our best interest that you spell out your
  partiality towards my people and my national origin as soon as possible,
  and that we part our ways from here.

if *any* of these points upset you do not consider me for collab!!!
do not waste my precious time (or yours)!
