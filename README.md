i am ethan and i exist (??????)

anyways.... do not disrupt my sleep (even when you think i
should be awake), do not ask me for ETA for anything, or i
will bash you in the head with a comically large metal pipe.

## account clarification

So my usual "personal" account is uh [this](github.com/rapidcow),
but because i am egostical and want to create an account
with my name, and because i also want to maintain distance
with school and work, i made this account.  (originally
when rapidcow/perspective was still a thing, it was meant
to go the other way around... but you don't need to know
that.) My real "personal" website is also at www (dot)
(that username) (dot) org, but you are not allowed to
talk about that; go to www.endfindme.com please. :)

Another difference is I may grant people partial access to
my repositories here, for example [site-wisc-sdc-fa25-team](https://github.com/eyzmeng/site-wisc-sdc-fa25-team)
(so people could (in theory) edit the site like a wiki by
pushing directly to my repository if they wanted to.)
This is not the case for my other account (and even for
this one, I have GitHub Actions disabled so you can't
expect to "escalate privilege" that way. :P)

## ABOUT J\*B

please just go to www.endfindme.com. also i'm
just a sophomore in case that disappoints you

The email you should use is **hire** at (my domain)
where (my domain) can be endfindme.com *or* endfind.me
*or* (my main account's username) (dot) org.

please do not email arbitrary Git commit emails.
it's not like i can control what you do, but c'mon...
don't be annoying.  We're not friends, and you don't
get to call me Ethan. >:(

## Facts?

having talked to a nonzero number of people this year
i figured it'd be nice to put up a something here.
(who knows? i might even be able to refer to it later.)

my go-to C programming reference is
[APUE](http://www.apuebook.com/apue3e.html) and
[CS631APUE](https://www.youtube.com/c/cs631apue),
besides the lovely manpages of course.
my favorite programming language is [Perl 5](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/perl-5.6.0/README#L90-L94)
(it would have been Python if not for the modern revamp
of the email library being getting a little too "opinionated",
and if not for it being used heavily for AI... (i still
use Python because dang is the standard library *good*
everywhere else.))  and my IDE is [Unix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYwYLR3UD2w&list=PL0qfF8MrJ-jwhsdAzkyez4V1uCLQm-Uq1&index=1)
(aka POSIX!  that includes vi, ed, sed, grep, awk --
and of course perl.  (In reality, I use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
instead of vi, because Unicode support and bunch of
other goodies like Netrw.))

my first non-Mac OS non-Windows computer runs
[Arch](https://archlinux.org/) (because why not???
and also it respects my peculiar choice of disk
partitioning.  (also Arch Wiki, AUR are some of the
best out there.))  my favorite VT console font is
default8x9 (`setfont -9 -d`, though i will admit it
sucks when i put it next to Chinese); and for graphical
stuff i use dwm/xterm (sometimes) and Xfce
(way more often than I should be!)

oh, and for data backup i use [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/)!
