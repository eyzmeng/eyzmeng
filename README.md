Hi, I'm Ethan/Yizheng from
<strong>@<a style="color:inherit"
            href="https://github.com/rapidcow"
          >rapidcow</a></strong>. This will
probably be a [machine account][] as per
GitHub's [terms of service][], though I have no
idea what I will be using this for at the moment.

(I originally planned to use this to host my
personal/school Git repos, but welp....)
