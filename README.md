## about me in your projects

here are some reasons you may *not* want me in your project
(since apparently it takes some people an in-person meeting
to realize these blatantly obvious signs)

* I support Free and Open Software and despise mega corporations
* I enjoy open file formats and open protocols.  I despite Walled
  Gardens, undocumented database schemas, obfuscated JavaScript,
  and more.  I despite software used to spy on, control, collect
  personally identifiable information of, and/or manipulate people.
* I advocate for rights to repair, rights to data ownership,
  rights to not being sold to advertisers, and rights to be
  forgotten (GDPR).  If your app practices data farming or shady
  business practices, it is in our best interest that we part.
* I am (undiagnosed, but very possibly) autistic and will interpret
  your words very literally, and may criticize you very directly.
  That isn't to say that I don't care about your feelings; I just
  believe that corporate getalong "friendliness" is the *lack* of
  capacity to care about whatever the heck you are talking about.
* I may "steal" work, but I make sure to give credit to people
  whose work I benefit from whenever I can.  A friend, an artist
  on the Web, a humble programmer --- even a s&#42;&#42;tpost YouTuber.
  If you are the egotistical, all-eyes-on-me kind of person, I would
  rather lay my eyes on anyone but you.
  
  Oh, and I am not a saint, but I think I deserve to be credited for 
  the work I have done.  If you think you can have me do work promoting
  your idea, while making it sound like you made it all, you may consider
  looking for people who have no ego or self-respect instead.  (Actually,
  for the sake of their well-being, don't go looking for anyone at all.
  If you can't be bothered to thank people for helping while wanting it
  to sound like you do all the work, you might as well deserve to do it
  alone to live up to the prophecy.)
* I do not enjoy AI buzzwords.  I do not vibe code.
  (I may vibe code for *your* codebase!  But please keep that slop
  as far away from my personal projects as possible.)
* [I am a f&#42;&#42;king webmaster](https://justinjackson.ca/webmaster/).
  I do not make websites for commerce (with the *sole* exception being
  www.endfindme.com, because surprise, I have to live).  I do not make
  websites to look tall, staggering, formiddable.  Or paint a reality
  with plastic faces, with corporate clipart, with the urban minimalist
  aesthetics; sterile and idyllic; sweetening to the point of sickening.
  Making is my passion; it's so I can bring change to the world.
  It's so that someone can find peace --- that I can find peace --- in
  a chaotic world and the unrelenting flow of time, overwhelmed by senses
  and overridden by grief, crushed by the apathetic and hurt by the
  careless... that doesn't come from the rejection of human nature
  and imperfection; or a detachment from the range of emotions, but
  rather embrace it, cherish it, and spend every second not regretting
  to be human in it.  
  (I may make exceptions for you; I can't say the same about you for me!)

if any of these points upset you do not consider me for collab!!!
do not waste my precious time (or yours)!
